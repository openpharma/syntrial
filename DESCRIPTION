Description: Syntrial takes as input the data of a clinical trial in SDTM format
    (https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/sdtm). For each synthesized patient
    a number of source patients is selected. From the source patients' data randomly
    weighted numeric values or, for categorical variables, one value is selected in
    a modification of classical bootstrap.
